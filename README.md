# train-scheduler Homework 7

### What does it do?

The basic idea of this website is to be able to reflect a database's information onto the site. In addition to displaying the information, it can also take in user input and store that in the database, then display the user's information. 

When the user inputs the first train's time, and the frequency at which the train comes, the javascript that I have written takes that information, compares it to the current time, and then outputs the time the next train is coming, and how many minutes until the next train.
